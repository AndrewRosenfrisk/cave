# Deep Cave

## About

This program is an animation of a deep cave that descends forever into the earth. 
Although short, this program takes advantage of the scrolling nature of the computer 
screen to produce an interesting and unending visualization, proof that it doesn’t 
take much code to produce something fun to watch. This program is similar 
to Project 58, “Rainbow.”
